# Starfish

A simple chess engine that implements alpha-beta pruning in Java. It's not very efficient but it can play decent chess :)

## Current features:
 - Alpha-beta pruning
 - Undo moves
 - Import / export FEN
 - Material & position evaluation
 - Castling & En Passant
 - Promotion (to queen, for now)

## TODO:
 - Implement knight promotion?
 - Get game state (opening, middlegame, or endgame) and play accordingly
 - Implement UCI protocol
