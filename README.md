# Starfish

A simple chess engine that implements alpha-beta pruning in Java. It's not very efficient but it can play decent chess :)

TODO:
 - Implement more efficient way of eliminating illegal moves (padded safety board?)
 - Write Board constructor that imports FEN
 - Write method that exports current board position as FEN
 - Implement castling
 - Implement en passant (future)
